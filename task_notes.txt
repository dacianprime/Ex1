Exercise 1 notes
----------------

Tasks completed:
1. fixed bugs
2. fixed code anomalies eg extern int main (extern by default not required), nonstandard function declarations, ternary operator removed
3. moved function prototypes and struct declaration to header file
4. tidied code and refactored to meaningful names
5. added comments

Suggestions for further improvements:
1. string of [30] char seems a little wasteful.. could possibly improve?
2. add check for strings of +30 size


Suggested unit tests (tested but required alteration of code.. needs proper driver):
1. As is
2. Larger data set
3. Empty string (various combinations ie at beginning, indespersed, at end)
4. Empty dataset
